(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.

## Browser checks

Playwright with installed Chromium: arrow-key walking, Space jump, platform landing, spring launch, wall slide and wall kick all passed assertions. Compound body has six parts, infinite inertia and ignoreGravity=true. Browser console reported zero errors/warnings after page reload. Screenshot: output/playwright/lab.png (local, ignored).

## Integration limits

Matter uses floating point. Authoritative server validation needs a trusted collision resolver and matching level identity; replay input alone does not prove a valid clear. Crouch retains the standing hull. One-way filtering and gameplay entity responses belong to the host. Vite's only build warning is the large Phaser bundle shown above.

`npm ci --dry-run --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund` also passed from game-core under npm 10.9.8. The lockfile has two ISC toolchain transitives outside the requested license allowlist; see SOURCES.md. Runtime dependency Phaser is MIT.
